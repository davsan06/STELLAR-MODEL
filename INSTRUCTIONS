Some advices if you want to run the code:

1. The main code is the file: "Modelo_Numerico_Interior_Estelar.py" which gets you the parameters: temperature, pressure, luminosity and 
mass over the different layers by integration for a given initial conditions (total mass, chemical composition, total radius and total
luminosity). Among all the possibilities for the central temperature of the star it gives the one that minimize the relative total error
(differencies in the parameters when both integrations plug)

2. Some 'extra' code is: "Calculo_configuracion_optima.py" which gets among all the different possibilities from combinations of total 
luminosity and total radius given by an initial array the model that minimizes the error.

WARNING!!! In the second step code you have to run the main file (step 1) take into account that you have to mute (or erase) the inputs of
Ltot and Rtot.
